This is an error.log parser to provide performance information

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

1) It provides summaries of response times
This is useful for setting scaling factors in
performance analysis.

2) The report can be connected up to Jenkins to cause
failure and notify developers to clean up issues

3) It gives you a rough overview of the performance of your
system without having to log through Apache

Optional commands:

  -error=Error level in ms (default 4000 ms)
  -dumpfile= Location to dump lines that are passed the ERROR threshold (default all_error.txt)
